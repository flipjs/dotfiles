Environment:
- Mac Mini 2012

Errors:
  $ tmux
  dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/lib/libevent-2.0.5.dylib
    Referenced from: /usr/local/bin/tmux
    Reason: image not found

Cause:
- Latest update from OS X
  - unsure what updates were installed
  - checking current version of OS X, it show `10.14.6`

Solution:
- https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/127186/installing-tmux-but-getting-dyld-library-not-loaded-referenced-from-usr
  - accepted answers didn't work for me
  - What worked is this:
    - ln -s libevent-2.1.7.dylib libevent-2.1.6.dylib
